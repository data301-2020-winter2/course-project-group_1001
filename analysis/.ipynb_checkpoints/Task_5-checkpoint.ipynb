For the Soviet Union, this means including modern Russian teams, teams that belonged to the Empire of Russia, as well as the Unified Soviet Team. For Germany, this means including the Empire of Germany, East Germany, West Germany,  and the Saar Protectorate, alongside its modern form. Now that we are considering all modern and historical versions of the countries mentioned, we can start with the analysis."
