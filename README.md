The competitive aspect of the olympics is what makes it a high intensity event which is why this data is so valuable and interesting. The Olympics showcase individuals talents and the data collected is fascinating to read and analyze since it usually contains something everyone enjoys.

Our dataset is about the performance of olympic athletes from the foundation of the olympics in 1896 to 2016. It includes various different types of info, including where each athlete is from, which sport they participated in, their name, which olympics they participated in, as well as if they were able to win a medal or not. The dataset also includes which exact event the athlete competed in, and it lists the age that they were when they competed. Whether the athlete competed in the  winter olympics or the summer olympics is also included. The data all comes from historic records of previous olympics, and was collected through www.sports-reference.com, a sports statistic site. The purpose of this dataset is probably for analytics, and as a type of historical record. Since many different types of information about the olympics can be determined using this dataset, which could be used to pinpoint historic events, while also possibly predict outcomes for future olympics.
